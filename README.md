## About This Fork

This plugin is based on the original work by xiaomac: [https://github.com/xiaomac/oss-upload](https://github.com/xiaomac/oss-upload)

The original author hasn't updated the project for several years and it was no longer maintained. To adapt to new WordPress versions, I've made updates based on the original project. The plugin itself is well-designed, doesn't conflict with other plugins, and uses a very reasonable approach for image display.
